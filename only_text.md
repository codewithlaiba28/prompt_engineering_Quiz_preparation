## Assessment Questions

Test your understanding with these questions:

### Quiz 1: Basic Understanding
**Question**: What is the main difference between prompt engineering and context engineering?

**Answer**: Prompt engineering is for conversational interactions where you can iteratively refine responses. Context engineering is for building AI applications where you need comprehensive, standalone instruction sets that handle all scenarios autonomously.

### Quiz 2: AI Agent Components
**Question**: Name the six essential components of any AI agent and briefly explain why each is necessary.

**Answer**: 
1. **Model** - Core AI processing power
2. **Tools** - External system integration
3. **Knowledge/Memory** - Information storage and retrieval
4. **Audio/Speech** - Natural interaction capabilities
5. **Guardrails** - Safety and compliance mechanisms
6. **Orchestration** - Deployment and monitoring systems

### Quiz 3: Practical Application
**Question**: You're building a customer service AI agent. What specific scenarios would you need to account for in your context engineering?

**Answer**: Billing problems, refund issues, login problems, terms and conditions queries, irrelevant questions, abusive behavior, escalation procedures, knowledge base access, and proper tone maintenance.
